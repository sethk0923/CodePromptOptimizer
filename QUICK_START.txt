   - Keywords from your prompt will be used to find relevant code sections
2. (Optional) Click "Browse" to include a code or binary file
3. Click "Optimize Steps" to process your input
4. View the optimized output in the bottom text box
   - Notice relevance scores next to each code section (higher is better)

Understanding Relevance Scores
----------------------------
- When you enter a prompt, the optimizer extracts important keywords
- Each code section is analyzed for these keywords
- Sections are assigned a relevance score from 0-100
- Higher scores indicate better matches to your prompt keywords
- Sections are sorted by relevance score in the output
- The status bar shows which keywords were matched

Token Limits
-----------
- Maximum total tokens: 2,500
- Maximum tokens per step: 500

Tips
----
- Be specific in your prompts to get better keyword matching
- Use Tab key while typing to see word suggestions
- The status bar shows processing information and keyword matches
- Click the theme button (‚òÄÔ∏è/üåô) to toggle between light and dark mode
- View relevance scores in the output to see how sections match your keywords
- The tool now handles non-UTF8 files automatically
- For large inputs, the UI stays responsive during processing
- For binary decompilation, install Ghidra (see GHIDRA_INTEGRATION.txt)
